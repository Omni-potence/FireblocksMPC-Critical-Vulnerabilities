# 🚨 Critical Vulnerabilities in Fireblocks MPC Implementation 🚨

This repository documents three critical security vulnerabilities discovered in the Fireblocks Multi-Party Computation (MPC) cryptographic library. These vulnerabilities could lead to complete compromise of private keys, unauthorized transactions, and system-wide security failures.

## 💥 Vulnerabilities Overview

### 1. ⚠️ Nonce Reuse Vulnerability (Critical)
A catastrophic implementation flaw in the ECDSA signing protocol allows nonce reuse across different signing sessions. When the same nonce is used to sign two different messages, an attacker can trivially recover the private key, completely compromising the cryptographic system.

### 2. 🔓 Protocol Abort Vulnerability (High)
Strategic abortion of the MPC protocol at specific phases leaks sensitive cryptographic material, including nonces and intermediate computation results. This allows malicious participants to extract private information that should remain confidential.

### 3. ⏱️ Side-Channel Vulnerability (High)
Non-constant-time operations in cryptographic functions leak information through timing variations. By analyzing execution times, attackers can potentially recover secret values used in the cryptographic operations.

## 🧪 Proof of Concept

This repository includes proof-of-concept exploits for all three vulnerabilities:

- `test_nonce_reuse.py`: Demonstrates how private keys can be recovered when nonces are reused
- `test_protocol_abort.py`: Shows information leakage when the protocol is aborted at strategic points
- `test_side_channel.py`: Illustrates timing variations that leak information about secret values

## 📊 Test Results

The `*_results.log` files contain the output of running the proof-of-concept exploits, confirming the presence of these vulnerabilities.

## 📑 Detailed Reports

Comprehensive PDF reports are included for each vulnerability, detailing:
- Technical analysis of the vulnerability
- Impact assessment
- Exploitation techniques
- Recommended mitigations

## 🛡️ Recommendations

### For Fireblocks MPC Users:
- Update to patched versions as soon as they become available
- Implement additional security controls to detect and prevent exploitation
- Consider using alternative cryptographic libraries until these issues are resolved

### For Fireblocks Developers:
- Implement RFC 6979 for deterministic nonce generation
- Ensure secure protocol abort handling that clears sensitive information
- Implement constant-time operations for all cryptographic functions
- Add comprehensive validation checks for cryptographic parameters
